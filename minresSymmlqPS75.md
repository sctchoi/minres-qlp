# Question #

I read the paper about MINRES-QLP. But I have some questions. Since I don't understand MINRES and SYMMLQ very well, there are some difficulties to understand your paper. When I read the paper "Solution of Sparse Indefinite Systems of Linear Equations" by C. C. Paige and M. A. Saunders, I was a little confused about the structure and the explanations. Can you recommend some other papers that focus on MINRES and SYMMLQ?

The 1975 paper may not be an easy one to understand and Chapter 2 in Choi's thesis (http://bit.ly/Nl6XI7) could be considered an attempt to demystify some of the key ideas. The book by Van der Vorst (http://bit.ly/Nl6N3n) is a good one as well.
