# Question #

I am a student in ME department of [â€¦] University. My research is on the numerical modeling of turbulent and spray, so I am quite interested in numerical aspects of the computation. I benefit a lot from Prof. Gene Golub 's CME302 course notes; it's so clear and concise. And as I am using Krylov based "hype" a lot, I felt that I should read the CME 324 note, which is not able on the 2004-2005 (failed links) or 2005-2006 webpage. I didn't know that Prof. Golub has deceased, and I almost sent my request to his old email this morning. It's amazing to think how his work is still influencing the new comers like me. As an expert on this area, could you please give me some advise on how I should approach the subject? And if available, could you please send me a copy of the CME324 notes and possibly other notes in this series as well?

A number of good books on Krylov subspace methods are available:
Trefethen and Bau, Demmel, Golub and van Loan, Saad, van der Vorst;
see http://j.mp/WmPttk for details.

Apparently many of Gene's CME 324 lecture notes from Spring 2006 are archived at http://j.mp/WmNJ3u
