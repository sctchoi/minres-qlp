#summary Is "final increase in rnorm" a bug?

= Question =

The script shows the input and summarizes in comments what
happened with rtol = 1e-8 and 1e-12 (with maxxnorm = 1e+8 both times).
In more detail, for the second case we have

{{{
   b1   = ones(n,1);
   maxxnorm = 1e+8;
   rtol = 1e-12;
   x2   = minresQLP(A,b1,rtol,maxit,M,shift,maxxnorm,acondlim,trancond);
}}}

and the log begins and ends with

{{{
Enter minresQLP.  Min-length solution of symmetric (A-sI)x = b or min ||(A-sI)x - b||
n      =   3200   ||b||    = 5.657e+01   shift    = 0.000e+00   rtol     = 1.000e-12

As commented in the script, the final increase in rnorm is what seems to
imply a bug. 


= Answer =

Normally rnorm is monotonically decreasing in MINRES-QLP. However, in the last iteration of MINRES-QLP, an increase in rnorm is not a bug if there is a decrease in xnorm. It is a regularization feature of MINRES-QLP.
